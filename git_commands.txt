some git commands:

git clone -- given a url it makes a local copy of a repo

git branch -- allows us to keep code separated based on what we are trying to develop

git branch -a -- shows us the existing branches on our repository

git remote -v -- shows us the url/repository that our current repo is aware of

git add -- lets us add new files to be tracked by git to our repo

git commit -a -- saves all of our changes on the local computer into a thing called a commit. A commit is a set of changes.

git commit file1 file2 ... -- commits only specific file changes to our local branch.

git push -- this will send our local commits to our default remote git service (e.g. github.)

git pull -- check the remote server for new commits. if there are then this command will fetch them (git fetch) then it will merge the new changes with our local branch (with a git merge)
